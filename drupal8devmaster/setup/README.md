# The setup directory
This directory contains the database backup and the site configuration .tar.gz file.

## How to use the database backup and the configuration files
As you check out a branch of the repository, you will have the latest version of each file. You do not need to use both of them; you will use one or the other. For instance, if you use the database backup it will capture everyting including the configuration. If you do not want to import the data from the example site then use the configuration file.

When you check out branch "section-{0-9}{0-9}" or branch "section-{0-9}{0-9}-lesson-{0-9}{0-9}" and use either file, you will be prepared to begin that section / lesson. For example, let's say that you checked out branch "section-01-lesson-08." After you use either file you will be ready to start watching Video 01.08. The student exercise from Video 01.07 will be complete. If you check out "section-02" and use either file you will be ready to watch Video 02.01. If you use the database backup then you will have all of the content created. If you use only the configuration file then you will have only the content that is already in your database.

You've always got the branches available to you, so feel free to experiment with checking out branches and using the files and it will all make sense!
